<p>This page was created to talk about my 3rd Year Project of my undergraduate BSc in Music Technology. The project is based around implementing granular synthesis on an Arduino ATmega328 board, and making some form of tangible (and hopefully musical) instrument from it. GitHub will be hosting the code I write as firmware for the instrument, and probably some schematics and board layouts towards the end of the project.</p>

<p>The project has been running from the start of the academic year (start of October) and will be submitted on May 16th, which will probably either the last time I update this page, or the point when I add the next project I am going to work on (but that's getting ahead of myself).</p>

<p>Anything I create and host here will be open source, and useable for your projects. The only thing I ask is if you do anything cool with it, you drop me an email and tell me!</p>
